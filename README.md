# slopes

![R CMD Check via
{tic}](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/slopes/workflows/R%20CMD%20Check%20via%20%7Btic%7D/badge.svg)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of slopes is to enable fast, accurate and user friendly
calculation longitudinal steepness of linear features such as roads and
rivers, based on commonly available input datasets such as road
geometries and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of slopes from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("slopes") -->

<!-- ``` -->

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("itsleeds/slopes")
```

## Usage

Load the package in the usual way:

``` r
library(slopes)
```

We will also load the `sf` library:

``` r
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.8.0, GDAL 3.0.4, PROJ 7.0.0
```

<!-- We will also use the `sf` package for representing road segments: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- library(sf) -->

<!-- ``` -->

The minimum data requirements for using the package are elevation
points, either as a vector, a matrix or as a digital elevation model
(DEM) encoded as a raster dataset. Typically you will also have a
geographic object representing the roads or similar features. These two
types of input data are represented in the code output and plot below.

``` r
# A raster dataset included in the package:
class(dem_lisbon_raster) # digital elevation model
#> [1] "RasterLayer"
#> attr(,"package")
#> [1] "raster"
summary(raster::values(dem_lisbon_raster)) # heights range from 0 to ~100m
#>    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
#>   0.000   8.598  30.233  33.733  55.691  97.906    4241
raster::plot(dem_lisbon_raster)

# A vector dataset included in the package:
class(lisbon_road_segments)
#> [1] "sf"         "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
plot(sf::st_geometry(lisbon_road_segments), add = TRUE)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-dem-lisbon-1.png" width="100%" />

Calculate the average gradient of each road segment as follows:

``` r
lisbon_road_segments$slope = slope_raster(lisbon_road_segments, e = dem_lisbon_raster)
#> [1] TRUE
summary(lisbon_road_segments$slope)
#>    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#> 0.00000 0.01246 0.03534 0.05462 0.08251 0.27583
```

This created a new column, `slope` that represents the average, distance
weighted slope associated with each road segment. The units represent
the percentage incline, that is the change in elevation divided by
distance. The summary of the result tells us that the average gradient
of slopes in the example data is just over 5%. This result is equivalent
to that returned by ESRIâ€™s `Slope_3d()` in the [3D Analyst
extension](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/tools/3d-analyst-toolbox/slope.htm),
with a correlation between the ArcMap implementation and our
implementation of more than 0.95 on our test datast (we find higher
correlations on larger datasets):

``` r
cor(
  lisbon_road_segments$slope,    # slopes calculates by the slopes package
  lisbon_road_segments$Avg_Slope # slopes calculated by ArcMap's 3D Analyst extension
)
#> [1] 0.9770436
```

We can now visualise the slopes calculated by the `slopes` package as
follows:

``` r
raster::plot(dem_lisbon_raster)
plot(lisbon_road_segments["slope"], add = TRUE, lwd = 5)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-slope-vis-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r
# mapview::mapview(lisbon_road_segments["slope"], map.types = "Esri.WorldStreetMap")
```

Imagine that we want to go from Santa Catarina to the East of the map to
the Castelo de Sao Jorge to the West of the map:

``` r
mapview::mapview(lisbon_route)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-route-1.png" width="100%" />

We can convert the `lisbon_route` object into a 3d linestring object as
follows:

``` r
lisbon_route_3d = slope_3d(lisbon_route, dem_lisbon_raster)
#> [1] TRUE
```

We can now visualise the elevation profile of the route as follows:

``` r
plot_slope(lisbon_route_3d)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot_slope-1.png" width="100%" />

If you do not have a raster dataset representing elevations, you can
automatically download them as follows.

``` r
lisbon_route_3d_auto = slope_3d(r = lisbon_route)
#> Loading required namespace: ceramic
#> Preparing to download: 12 tiles at zoom = 15 from 
#> https://api.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.terrain-rgb/
#> [1] TRUE
plot_slope(lisbon_route_3d_auto)
```

# Performance

For this benchmark we will download the following small (\< 100 kB)
`.tif` file:

``` r
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/slopes/releases/download/0.0.0/dem_lisbon.tif"
if(!file.exists("dem_lisbon.tif")) download.file(u, "dem_lisbon.tif")
```

A benchmark can reveal how many route gradients can be calculated per
second:

``` r
e = dem_lisbon_raster
r = lisbon_road_segments
et = terra::rast("dem_lisbon.tif")
res = bench::mark(check = FALSE,
  slope_raster = slope_raster(r, e, terra = FALSE),
  slope_terra1 = slope_raster(r, e, terra = TRUE),
  slope_terra2 = slope_raster(r, et, terra = TRUE)
)
res
#> # A tibble: 3 x 6
#>   expression        min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
#>   <bch:expr>   <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
#> 1 slope_raster     44ms   49.3ms      20.3    32.7MB     5.06
#> 2 slope_terra1   37.7ms     42ms      23.1    32.7MB     5.12
#> 3 slope_terra2   37.2ms   41.9ms      24.2    29.4MB     4.83
```

That is approximately

``` r
round(res$`itr/sec` * nrow(r))
#> [1] 5489 6250 6551
```

routes per second using the `raster` and `terra` (the default if
installed, using `RasterLayer` and native `SpatRaster` objects) packages
to extract elevation estimates from the raster datasets, respectively.

The message: use the `terra` package to read-in DEM data for slope
extraction if speed is important.

To go faster, you can chose the `simple` method to gain some speed at
the expense of accuracy:

``` r
e = dem_lisbon_raster
r = lisbon_road_segments
res = bench::mark(check = FALSE,
  bilinear1 = slope_raster(r, e, terra = TRUE),
  bilinear2 = slope_raster(r, et, terra = TRUE),
  simple1 = slope_raster(r, e, method = "simple", terra = TRUE),
  simple2 = slope_raster(r, et, method = "simple", terra = TRUE)
)
# ?bench::mark
res
#> # A tibble: 4 x 6
#>   expression      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
#>   <bch:expr> <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
#> 1 bilinear1    38.8ms   43.7ms      22.3    32.7MB     8.38
#> 2 bilinear2    31.9ms   38.4ms      25.0    29.4MB     4.55
#> 3 simple1      30.6ms   36.1ms      27.2    29.3MB     4.53
#> 4 simple2      31.8ms   37.7ms      25.7    29.4MB     4.68
```

The equivalent benchmark with the `raster` package is as follows:

``` r
e = dem_lisbon_raster
r = lisbon_road_segments
res = bench::mark(check = FALSE,
  bilinear = slope_raster(r, e, terra = FALSE),
  simple = slope_raster(r, e, method = "simple", terra = FALSE)
)
# ?bench::mark
res
#> # A tibble: 2 x 6
#>   expression      min   median `itr/sec` mem_alloc `gc/sec`
#>   <bch:expr> <bch:tm> <bch:tm>     <dbl> <bch:byt>    <dbl>
#> 1 bilinear     37.7ms   47.1ms      21.7    32.7MB     8.15
#> 2 simple       32.8ms   38.4ms      26.8    29.3MB     4.86
```

<!-- That is sufficient for our needs but we plan to speed-up the calculation, e.g. using the new `terra` package, as outlined this [thread](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/issues/29#issuecomment-619444555). -->
