# Introduction

Slopes are important for many purposes, including flood risk, agriculture, geology, and infrastructure constructions. The information about slopes is very relevant for vehicle routing modes that are sensitive to going up or down steep hills (e.g. bicycles, trains, and large trucks).

Altough there are several ways to name "slope", such as "steepness", "hilliness", "inclination", "aspect", "gradient", "declivity", the reffered `slopes` in this package can be defined as the "longitudinal gradient" [@cohen_global_2018].

# Calculating slopes

The most comomn slope calculation method is defined by the vertical difference of the final and start point or line height (z1 and z0) divided by the horizontal lenght that apparts them.

$$
s = \Delta z/l
$$

Depending on the purpouse of application, it might me relevant to understand how hilliness is estimated.  

## Assessing route hilliness

The hilliness of a route is an important factor which can affect its suitability for activities such as cycling.

Using the `slopes` package we can estimate the gradient of individual road segments. When these segments are combined into routes, we then need a means of assessing the hilliness of the entire route. A range of indices can be used to represent route hilliness. The choice of which index is most appropriate may be context dependent.

- Mean distance weighted gradient. Perhaps the simplest and most widely applicable measure is the mean gradient of the route. This should be weighted by the distance of each segment.

- Max gradient. For activities like cycling, where steep hills have a disproportionate impact, it may be useful to consider the maximum gradient.

- Xth percentile gradient. Since the maximum gradient gives no information about the rest of the route segments, other measures such as the 75th percentile gradient could be more informative.

- Inverted harmonic mean. If we use the following formula we will get an index that (like the arithmetic mean) makes use of the full dataset, but that is weighted towards the higher gradient segments. Whether this index is helpful remains to be tested.

$$
H(x) = 1 - distance.weighted.harmonic.mean(1-x)
$$

# Implementation in the slopes package

To help research slopes using open source software for reproducibility, we have developed the slopes package.
After you have installed it, load it as follows:

```{r setup}
library(slopes)
```

# Thoughts
## Segments in a route: Commulative slope 
The length of a segment in a route is also a relevant factor to have in consideration. 
If it is ok to bike through a segment of 8% with $x$ lenght, it is not so ok to bike in four segments in a row like that one (8% for 4$x$ length).
