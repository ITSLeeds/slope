# Introduction

Slopes are important for many purposes, including flood risk and vehicle routing modes that are sensitive to going up or down steep hills (e.g. bicycles and large trucks)...

Slopes can be defined as the "longitudinal gradient" [@cohen_global_2018].

# Calculating slopes

$$
r = e/d

# Implementation in the slopes package

To help research slopes using open source software for reproducibility, we have developed the slopes package.
After you have installed it, load it as follows:

```{r setup}
library(slopes)
```
