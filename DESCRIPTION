Description: Functions and example data to support research into
  'longitudinal gradient' (slope) of linear geographic entities, as defined in the context of rivers
  by Cohen et al. (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.06.066>.
  The package was initially developed to research road slopes but has also been
  used to calculate and visualise slopes of rivers and, using an open dataset
  published by Javier Ariza-López et al. (2019) <doi:10.1038/s41597-019-0147-x>, trajectories representing
  movement on roads.
  The package takes two main types of input data for slope calculation: vector geographic
  objects representing linear features, and raster geographic objects with elevation values
  (which can be downloaded using functionality in the package)
  representing a continuous terrain surface.
